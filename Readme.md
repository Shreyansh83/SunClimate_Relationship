# Sun-Climate-Analysis

This repository contains the research and analysis conducted in the study of the relationship between the Sun's magnetic activities and their potential influence on Earthâ€™s climate. The study focuses on understanding how solar phenomena like cosmic rays, SSI, and sunspots correlate with cloud properties and influence climatic systems.

## Repository Structure

- `/Data` - Contains datasets used in the analysis.
- `/Scripts` - Jupyter notebooks with the data analysis.
- `/Docs` - The dissertation document and related materials.
- `/Images` - Visualizations and figures generated from the analysis.
